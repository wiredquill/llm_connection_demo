      # If your models are large and require specific node features (e.g., GPUs),
      # you might need to add node selectors, tolerations, or affinity rules.
      # For GPU access, you'd also need to configure the runtimeClass and resource requests/limits for GPUs.
      # Example (for NVIDIA GPUs, requires NVIDIA device plugin on nodes):
      # runtimeClassName: nvidia
      containers:
      - name: ollama
        image: ollama/ollama:latest # Use the official Ollama image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 11434 # Default Ollama port
          name: http
        # --- Volume for Ollama Models ---
        # This volume persists Ollama models even if the pod restarts.
        # For production, consider using a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) with a suitable StorageClass.
        # For simplicity here, we use an emptyDir which is ephemeral but good for testing.
        # If you use emptyDir, models will be re-downloaded if the pod is rescheduled to a new node.
        # To persist models across pod/node restarts, replace emptyDir with a PVC.
